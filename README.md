## Terms of service

The Flutter tool may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By
downloading or using the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service:
https://policies.google.com/terms

For example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged
archive), the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers
immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the `flutter` tool itself.
This will also occur when Flutter is upgraded (e.g. by running the `flutter
upgrade` command).
